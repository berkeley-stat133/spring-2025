## ðŸ“– Lecture

We continue discussing maps in R. In particular, we use two interesting data sets:

1) **IBTrACS shapefiles**. We'll use this to work with shapefiles, which is perhaps the most common format for vector data.

2) **US Presidential Election Results (2020)**. We'll use this data to make some choropleth maps. A choropleth map is a thematic map that is used to visualize how a variable varies across a geographic area.
