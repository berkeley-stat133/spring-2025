## ðŸ“– Lecture

We move on to our next topic which involves basic principles behind Text Mining, "_the process of distilling actionable insights from text_".

Broadly speaking, Text Mining analysis can be divided in two big categories: 1) Bag-of-Words (bow) analysis, and 2) Syntactic Parsing. In this course, we will focus exclusively on topics related to bag-of-words analysis.

__Preliminary Operations__: Because text data is rarely ready to be analyzed, we need to first discuss some of the common preparation steps for having text data in a way that can be mathematically/statistically analyzed.

__Frequency Analysis__: The most basic type of bag-of-words text mining analysis consists of counting the number of occurrences or frequencies of each token.
