## ðŸ“– Lecture

Welcome to Stat 133. Our first meeting is on Wednesday Aug-28 where we begin with the usual review of the course policies, logistics, overall expectations, topics in a nutshell, etc. As for Friday Aug-30, we start with an introduction to R vectors which are the most basic kind of data structure in R.

 

## ðŸ”¬ Lab

Getting started with R and RStudio: first, we want to make sure everybody has installed both programs; and then we will provide an introductory review of RStudioâ€™s workspace, as well as a brief intro to Quarto notebooks. 

BTW: there's nothing to submit this week.
