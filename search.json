    "text": "üîÜ Shiny Friday\nShiny is an open source R package (developed by Posit) that lets you build web applications using R (and RStudio). BTW: If you‚Äôve never seen a shiny app, you can find dozens of examples in a gallery curated by Posit: https://shiny.posit.co/r/gallery/\nDuring the first half of the semester (starting on Sep-6), every Friday lecture I will use a shiny example, describing various aspects about its structure, and reviewing some of its key details. Every week we‚Äôll go over a different shiny app, increasing the level of complexity, but also making it more interactive and richer.\nOur first shiny app involves the app that comes by default in RStudio called Old Faithful. This app is based on the famous geyser Old Faithful located in Yellowstone National Park. In particular, the app uses R‚Äôs built-in data set \"faithful\" which contains two variables:\n\neruptions: is the time (in min) of an eruption\nwaiting: is the waiting time (in min) to next eruption\n\nThe app is a very basic app that displays a histogram of the waiting times.\nhttps://github.com/data133/shiny/tree/main/old-faithful1-default",

    "text": "Will STAT 133 be offered in hybrid mode (both in-person and remotely, simultaneously)?  No, STAT 133 will not be offered in hybrid mode. Instead, all classes and sections are to be delivered in-person. If you have time conflicts with lecture and/or section, please don‚Äôt take STAT 133 this semester.\n\nWill attendance be enforced?  Attending class and section contributes to achieving the learning outcomes of this course. You should attend every class and section to the best of your abilities, but I understand that extenuating circumstances arise. If you cannot attend a class or section, please stay on track with the covered materials.\nOn a side note, here‚Äôs one fun fact from the students‚Äô course evaluations. The most common answer provided by the students when asked ‚ÄúWhat advice would you give to another student who is considering taking this course?‚Äù is: ‚ÄúGo to all the lectures and start working on assignments early.‚Äù\n\nWill there be live webcast or recordings of lectures?  Unless Campus authorities decide to switch to remote instruction, there won‚Äôt be live webcast or live zoom recordings. With that said, lectures may be recorded for archival purposes, but not necessarily be shared with the class.\n\nDo you have a Covid (or other illness) policy?  Maintaining your health and that of the Berkeley community is of primary importance to course staff, so if you are feeling ill or have been exposed to illness, please do not come to class. All of the materials used in class will be posted either in this website or in bCourses. Likewise, you‚Äôre encouraged to reach out to fellow students to discuss the class materials or stop by office hours to chat with the GSI, the tutor, or the instructor.\nHaving said that, we expect you to attend lecture and lab. Past experience tells us that students who constantly miss lecture/lab tend to have a mediocre performance.\nAlso, missing lecture/lab does not give you the right to use OH as a replacement for receiving instruction. We are always willing to help you understand the learning materials during OH, but this also requires that you make an honest effort reviewing them before coming to OH.\n\nI am a concurrent student. What are my chances of enrolling in the class?  Depending on the size of the waitlist, and the available space in the labs, you may or may not have a chance to join the class. For example, there have been semesters in which only 10% of concurrent applications have been accepted. Likewise, there have been semesters in which 100% of concurrent applications have been accepted.\nKeep in mind that the approval process for concurrent enrollment students takes place between the 2nd and 3rd week of instruction, and it is a somewhat slow 2-step process, which takes some days, and it involves not only my intervention but also the participation of one of the advisors in the Dept. of Statistics.\n\nI am a grad student officially enrolled. Do you have a grading structure for grad students?  This semester we don‚Äôt have a special grading structure for graduate students. All students will be evaluated with the same criteria. See the course syllabus for more information about the grading structure.\n\nWhat if I join the class late?  If you join the class within the first two weeks, read the syllabus and lecture notes, take a look at bCourses to get a sense of any assignments that may have already passed, and visit office hours to check that you‚Äôre up to date with things.\nAfter two weeks into the semester, you‚Äôll have too much material that you‚Äôll need to make up, so you will have to wait to a subsequent semester to take STAT 133.\n\nAre time conflicts allowed?  STAT 133 does not allow students to enroll with time conflicts.\n\nI would like to switch lab sections with other student. Is this possible?  This is not possible. You should attend the lab section you are officially enrolled in.\n\nIs this course a good fit if I don‚Äôt have any programming experience?  Quick answer: yes. Because Stat 133 has no prerequisites, we actually expect that many of you come without any coding experience. It is nice to have some programming experience under your belt, which makes the learning curve less steep. Having said that, if this is your first time coding, you should expect to spend a great amount of time doing work outside class (and also deal with the inevitable frustration that comes when learning any language).\n\nIs this course a good fit if I don‚Äôt have any data analysis experience?  Yes. Because STAT 133 has no prerequisites, we actually expect that most of you come without any data analysis experience. In this course you will be working with a variety of fairly simple real data sets, as well as with simulated data.\n\nIs this course a good fit if I‚Äôve already taken several programming courses?  You may find some parts of this course somewhat slow (and boring?) in terms of basics concepts such as data types, data structures, conditionals, loops, and functions. Unless Stat 133 is a required course for your major/minor (or you are eager to learn about R), please consider taking more advanced courses if what you are interested in is algorithms, computational statistics, databases, machine learning and statistical learning.\n\nIs this course a good fit if I don‚Äôt intend to major in Statistics?  STAT 133 is one of the core courses of the Statistics Major. The way I‚Äôve been teaching this course is having Statistics majors as my target audience. However, much of the content should be helpful for any student who has to analyze data, or for those majors with some sort of data-analysis concentration.\n\nWhat if I want to declare Statistics as my major, but I already have taken other programming courses on Campus?  You may need to talk to a student advisor for more information about this. In 2019, students that took Data 100 (e.g.¬†C100) ‚ÄúPrinciples & Techniques of Data Science‚Äù, were able to waive Stat 133 by just taking Stat 33B ‚ÄúIntroduction to Advanced Programming in R‚Äù. Please contact your advisor to know if this option is still available.\n\nIs this course a good fit to become a data scientist?  Becoming a data scientist is not a (one-semester) sprint. It is a (years-long) marathon. Like any other profession, it takes many years of learning, practice, practice, practice, and then some practice, to become a proficient data scientist/analyst. This course can be very useful, and we are confident it will help you to build a good foundation in your DS career.\n\nWhat if I don‚Äôt want to be a data scientist?  That‚Äôs perfect too. You don‚Äôt need to be a data scientist aspirant to take this course. Whether your plans are to become a consultant, life scientist, social scientist, journalist, or get some analytic skills, this course should be a good choice.\n\nWhy is R (and not python) the main computational tool used in Stat 133?  Historically, STAT 133 has always been taught with R, and this semester is no exception. Personally, I believe that both R and python are great tools, and it is a good idea that you learn both of them (especially if you are interested in Data Science, analytics, etc). STAT 133 gives you the opportunity to learn a fair amount of R. Quoting Hadley Wickham:\n\n‚ÄúGenerally, there are a lot of people who talk about R versus Python like it‚Äôs a war that either R or Python is going to win. I think that is not helpful because it is not actually a battle. These things exist independently and are both awesome in different ways‚Äù.\n\nOn a side note, Ross Ihaka, one of the creators of R, obtained his PhD at UC Berkeley (in the Dept. of Statistics), so it is no coincidence that we are heavily influenced by R.\n\nAre we going to learn about machine learning methods?  The Statistics department offers a dedicated course on this topic: STAT 154: Modern Statistical Prediction and Machine Learning. There is also CS 189: Introduction to Machine Learning offered through Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (EECS). Similarly, DATA 100: Principles and Techniques of Data Science covers several machine learning concepts.\n\nAre we going to learn about databases?  If you are interested in Databases you should consider CS 186: Introduction to Database Systems offered through Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (EECS).\n\nAre we going to learn about linear models?  The Statistics department offers a dedicated course on this topic: STAT 151A: Linear Modeling, Theory and Applications.\n\nAre we going to learn about introductory statistics and/or probability?  The Statistics department offers two core courses on these topics: STAT 134: Concepts of Probability, and STAT 135: Concepts of Statistics.\n\nAre we going to learn about Reproducible Research (RR)?  We are just going to scratch the surface. We will touch on dynamic documents, and some practices and tools that are useful in RR.\n\nCan we work in groups?  Yes, absolutely. We strongly encourage you to not work alone. Well, let me rephrase that. You should try to first work on your own (trial and error). Take notes of the things you don‚Äôt understand. Then get with other people and discuss ideas, share tips (but not the entire solution).\n\nAren‚Äôt you suppose to teach us?  Yes. But you don‚Äôt learn programming by watching someone else program. The same way that you don‚Äôt learn to swim by simply watching someone else swimming. You have to get into the pool, and do all the drills your instructor says. This is a very hands-on course, and you will be required to do a great amount of work on your own.\n\nWhat if I don‚Äôt agree with all the course policies?  If there is one or more policies you don‚Äôt agree with, then please reconsider your enrollment in the course. I am assuming that all students completely agree with the course policies described in the Syllabus.\n\nCan I ask you to write me a Letter of Recommendation (LoR)?  Please take a look at this document before asking me to write you a letter of recommendation: https://github.com/gastonstat/letter-of-rec.\n\nI invited you to join my network in LinkedIn. Why haven‚Äôt you accepted my invitation?  First: Don‚Äôt take it personal. It‚Äôs not you, it‚Äôs me. Second: if you really want that I become part of your network, why don‚Äôt you talk to me in person? We can meet in OH, or you can also schedule a meeting at a different time. Let me know you better than just as a distant contact in a social media networking site.\n\nDo you have research projects open to undergrad students?  Lecturing takes most of my time and I don‚Äôt have a lab. Sometimes, however, I may look for collaborators to create some data-based project. This typically happens in the Summer.",

If you feel the need to disagree, do so respectfully and acknowledge the valid points in your classmate‚Äôs argument.\nRefrain from personal abuse. Don‚Äôt badmouth others or call them offensive words. You may express robust disagreement with what someone says, but don‚Äôt call them names.\nBe forgiving. If your classmate makes a mistake, don‚Äôt badger him or her for it. Just let it go.\nIf you reply to a question from a classmate, make sure your answer is accurate.\nBe brief. If you write a long dissertation in response to a simple question, it‚Äôs unlikely that anyone will spend the time to read through it all.\nRemember that your public posts are not anonymous. They can be read by your classmates.\nDon‚Äôt expect other people to do your homework for you. If you‚Äôre looking for technical help, for example, don‚Äôt ask questions you could easily answer yourself by reading the manual or help documentation provided with the software tools used in this course.",

For those who come from Data 8 or some previous coding experience in python, the first labs will help you transfer that knowledge over to R. Both languages are excellent platforms for analyzing data, are widely used in data science, and have their individual strengths. R has been developed within the statistics community specifically for data analysis, while python is a general-purpose programming language but has large data analysis capabilities.\nThe lectures tend to be focused on the data analysis concepts, while learning how to apply/use them in R tend to be the focus of the labs and assignments. Do not be surprised or worried about not following the details of R code during class‚Äîthat is not the point (furthermore, there will sometimes be code that is really specific to the instructional purposes of the lecture, e.g.¬†to make a specific plot, and is beyond the scope of what you would be expected to understand or know how to do it by yourself).",

If you find yourself in a situation that raises concerns about passing the course, please contact me as soon as possible.\nAbove all, please-please-please do not wait till the end of the semester to share your concerns about passing the course because it will be too late by then.",

Any such relationship jeopardizes the integrity of the educational process.\nAlthough faculty and staff can act as excellent resources for students, you should be aware that they are required to report any violations of this campus policy. If you wish to have a confidential discussion on matters related to this policy, you may contact the Confidential Care Advocates on campus for support related to counseling or sensitive issues. Appointments can be made by calling (510) 642-1988.\nThe classroom, lab, and work place should be safe and inclusive environments for everyone.

Keep in mind that the activities and assignments build upon earlier work. So it‚Äôs important not to fall behind and avoid leaving gaps along the semester.\nOn the technical side, you should have your own computer, (good) internet connection, download and install specific software (e.g.¬†R, RStudio, gitbash, zoom), and also know how to record a video of both 1) computer‚Äôs screen capture, and 2) face capture (e.g.¬†a zoom recording makes this easy).

Coding (in any programming language) can be extremely frustrating at times. You would be surprised to hear my collection of student stories about all sorts of bugs, typos, misspellings, and the like, that gave them a fair amount of frustration. So please, ask the teaching staff for help in a timely and respectful manner.\nAs for the last item, please let us know you‚Äôve been affected by circumstances beyond your control as soon as possible. While we cannot guarantee any outcome, we will do what is within our reach to help you in this class.",
